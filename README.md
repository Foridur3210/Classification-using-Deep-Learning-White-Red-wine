# Classification-using-Deep-Learning-White-Red-wine

Here I have used Classification techinque-Supervised Learning to solve the problem Dataset using Deep Learing. Here we are to determine whether the wine is red-wine or white-wine i.e. we are to classify it. Based on differnt features like pH level, acidic level, etc. we are to classify the same.

Also the datasets are extracted from urls provided in the notebook uploaded.

Thank you!!
